======================================> AWS RDS <============================================

    Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a collection of managed services that
             makes it simple to set up, operate, and scale databases in the cloud.

1). In database we are using mysql for storing the data.But in case of AWS we are using RDS(Relational
    database service ). for string the data. RDS support mysql, mariaDB, postgrass, oracle, Aurora.

2). In RDS we are using 20GB for free of one year.

3). Advantages of AWS RDS =>
			   1). Rds Backup
					1). Automated backup
					2). Snapshots
			   2). Restore Backup
			   3). Multi Availbility zone
			   4). Read Replica
1). Rds Backup are provide to take the two type of backup like automated backup and second one is snapshots
    (menual backup). It is maximum (1-35)days take backup of our database.

2). Restore backup => Restore backup is used for restore the data of our database.

3).Multi Availbility zone => It can be access to different-2 Region or different-2 availbility zone.

4). Read Replica => Amazon RDS Read Replicas enable you to create one or more read-only copies of your database 
    instance within the same AWS Region or in a different AWS Region.Updates made to the source database are then
    asynchronously copied to your Read Replicas.
   {- Assume you have 1 million bank users want to check the balance.
      suppose you want to read the rds data so there are only SELECT command running of (Read operations).
   {- write/update/delete operation are perform the Main DB .

  Kind of Read Replica database => 
			   1). Complete Replica
			   2). Partial Replica
			   3). Horizontal Replica
			   4). Vertical Replica

  Read Replica database are create the copy like (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5).

   ==> For creating database in RDS Follow these steps -------->

1). Login the aws and search for RDS and after that click on create database.

2). choose a database creation method => Standard create

3). Engine options => mysql or mariaDB ( select version of engine version ).

4). Templates => Free tier.

5). settings => Give the database name and user name and generate password (8-characters).

6). Instance configuration => we will select free tier.

7). Storage => allocated storage 20gb for free.

8). Storage autoscaling we will Enable storage autoscaling. Other options default set.

9). give the public access.VPC security group so we will choose existing or create new security groups
    ( EC2 security group or S3 security group).

10). Monitoring => Enable Enhanced monitoring.

11). Additional configuration => give the initial database name. Enable automated backups(how many time period 
     do you take the backup).Enable encryption and log exports enable.

12). After that click on create database.
